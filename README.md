# socketV2V
Mainline Linux Kernel integration of IEEE 802.11p, IEEE 1609.{3,4}, and developmental userspace utility for using J2735 over WAVE

## January 1 2019

To our community, our apologies that we went dark for a while - the good news is that we have re-implemented the DSRC stack (802.11p, IEEE 1609) and will be releasing it (here) soon, with compatibility for mediatek chips and others. Huzzah! At last! Open Source V2V! 

Look out for our next big push and DEFCON presentation!
